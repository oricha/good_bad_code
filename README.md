## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language used for both client-side and server-side development. However, with great power comes great responsibility. As developers, it's essential to understand the best practices and potential pitfalls of the language.

This repository aims to provide a learning resource for developers who want to improve their JavaScript coding skills. By examining good and bad code samples, developers can gain insights into what to do and what to avoid when writing JavaScript code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different file based for  "Good" and "Bad" code examples, such as:

- Async-await
- Renamed file
- Destructuring
- Loops
- Rest-params
- Spread-syntax
- Template-literals

Each folder contains subfolders for "Good" and "Bad" code examples. Within each subfolder, you'll find `.js` files that demonstrate the respective coding practices.
